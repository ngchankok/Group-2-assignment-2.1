# GIT & CLI: Assignment

## Brief

This is a research assignment where students will be given time for research and put into group for discussion.

Version control tools are plenty and have wide range of practices. This research assignment aims to help learners expand their choice of version control tools (Part 1) and being acquainted with the branching strategies best practices in the industry (Part 2).

### Part 1

Problem Statement: GIT is not the only version control tool in the industry.

[Reference Link](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/version-control-software/) or search online with key word "Version Control Tool".

Discussion Points:

1. What are the version control tools used in the industry?

1. Why are they being used?

### Part 2

Problem Statement: Branching strategy varies largely across companies’ practices and there are not fixed way of doing this.

Discussion Points:

1. How many branching strategies are there? What are they?
1. Which branching strategy looks the most practical for you personally?
1. Consider the following scenarios, recommend a branching strategy suitable for the scenario, and explain why?
   a. Startup with less than 5 developers
   Feature - Startup have to innovate and create new features for an app/page hence it is most suitable for single team startup.
   b. Startup with multiple small team of developers (3 teams of 3 developers)
   Hotfix - Multiple small teams are flexible to quick to react to minor updates hence hotfix is best suited for these situation.
   c. Startup with no specific team make up. It’s just a group of 8 developers.
   Development - The development branch would sound logical as the process requires many aspects of development. Staging, development and production needs to be laid out properly for the startup project.
   d. SME with multiple small team of developers (4 teams of 3 developers)
   Release - A release branch can be either short-lived or long-lived depending on the strategy. In either case, the release branch reflects a set of changes that are intended to go through the production release process.
   e. MNC & Banking with multiple large team of developers (10 teams of 12 developers)
   Trunk - The trunk branching would be most suitable as it offers foundation to a project and it may be a good way to stabilize the process.
