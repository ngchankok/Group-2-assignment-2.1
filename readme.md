### Part 1

Problem Statement: GIT is not the only version control tool in the industry. 

[Reference Link](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/version-control-software/) or search online with key word "Version Control Tool".

1. What are the version control tools used in the industry?
The various types of the version control systems are:

2. Centralized Version Control System
3. Distributed Version Control System

1. Why are they being used?
Local version control system maintains track of files within the local system. This approach is very common and simple. This type is also error prone which means the chances of accidentally writing to the wLocal version control system maintains track of files within the local system. This approach is very common and simple. This type is also error prone which means the chances of accidentally writing to the wrong file is higher.rong file is higher.

Distributed version control systems come into picture to overcome the drawback of centralized version control system. The clients completely clone the repository including its full history. If any server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied on to the server which help restore the server.



### Part 2
