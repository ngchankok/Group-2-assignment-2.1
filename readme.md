# GIT & CLI: Assignment

## Brief

This is a research assignment where students will be given time for research and put into group for discussion.

Version control tools are plenty and have wide range of practices. This research assignment aims to help learners expand their choice of version control tools (Part 1) and being acquainted with the branching strategies best practices in the industry (Part 2).

### Part 1

Problem Statement: GIT is not the only version control tool in the industry.

[Reference Link](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/version-control-software/) or search online with key word "Version Control Tool".

Discussion Points:

1. What are the version control tools used in the industry?

1. Why are they being used?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

### Part 2

Problem Statement: Branching strategy varies largely across companies’ practices and there are not fixed way of doing this.

Discussion Points:

1. How many branching strategies are there? What are they?
   There are 5 branching strategies. They are;
   a) Trunk Branch - In trunk-based development, the trunk is the central branch to which all developers send their code changes.
   b) Development Branch - The development branch is a long-lived feature branch that holds changes made by developers before they're ready to go to production.
   c) Feature Branch - Often used by a single developer for only their changes, but it is possible to share it with other developers.
   d) Release Branch - This reflects a set of changes that are intended to go through the production release process.
   e) Hotfix Branch - It is used generally to hold changes related to emergency bug fixes.
1. Which branching strategy looks the most practical for you personally?
1. Consider the following scenarios, recommend a branching strategy suitable for the scenario, and explain why?
   a. Startup with less than 5 developers
   b. Startup with multiple small team of developers (3 teams of 3 developers)
   c. Startup with no specific team make up. It’s just a group of 8 developers.
   d. SME with multiple small team of developers (4 teams of 3 developers)
   e. MNC & Banking with multiple large team of developers (10 teams of 12 developers)
